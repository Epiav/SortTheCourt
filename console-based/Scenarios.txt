1-1=1:Master Crafter Silas:'Your Grace,' he said, bowing before you. 'I offer you my services. To rule successfully, a ruler must be worshipped by his people. Allow me to build a church in your honour, and you shall have their unending support.'
1.<Gold;50>I accept your offer, Master Crafter, but do not let me regret this. @'You won't, my liege,' Silas said, an eager smile forming at his lips. (Gold-50)
2.I don't see the use. I will garner popularity through my actions, not the preachings of priests. @'Very well,' Silas said with a disapointed sigh. 'I had hoped you would see the advantage, but so be it.'
|
<1-1=1[1]>1-1=2:Master Crafter Silas:'Your Grace,' the Master Crafter said, bowing before you, a confident look painted on his face, despite the clear effort to conceal it. 'The Church you commissioned has finally been completed. It will be populated and running by the morrow.' (Faith+20)
1.Good work, Silas. Let's see if it pays off. @'It will, your grace,' the Master Crafter said confidently.
|
<1-1=2[1]>1-1=3:Master Crafter Silas:'Your Grace,' the Master Crafter greeted after only just entering the throne room, a distressed look on his face. 'It's the church! It was burned down in the night. Luckily, there were no casualties, but...,' he paused, taking a moment to gather himself. 'What do we do?', he asked, looking at you expectantly. (Faith-15)
1.Have the ones responsible hunted down and killed, and parade their traitorous corpses through the streets for all to see. @'It'll be done, my lord,' Silas said, a look of satisfaction crossing his face. It was clear he had yearned for revenge since hearing of his creation's destruction. (Faith+15)
2.Understood, Master Crafter, but there's nothing to be done. @'Nothing, my lord?' Silas asked, disbelieved. After a sigh, he added, 'So be it, then.'
3.<Gold;300>Construct a new church, then. A massive one. Gold is of no object. @'A brilliant idea, my lord,' Silas said, an aura of approval radiating from him at receiving the order. 'A Royal Church, grander than any other. I'll get to work immediately.' (Gold-300)
|
<1-1=3[3]>1-1=4:Master Crafter Silas:'I have news,' the Master Crafter started. 'The new Royal Church has finished it's contruction. We've assigned a High Priestess to its governance, and far more security than the previous one had. We won't run into the same issue as before.' (Faith+30)
1.Good. I won't suffer another insult at my rule. @'Of course, my liege,' the Master Crafter said subserviently.
|
<1-1=4[1]>1-1=5:High Priestess:'Greetings, my liege,' the High Priestess said, bowing before you. 'I have news concerning the new Royal Church. It's been a great success, of course, but... Well, it's just that we've had a bit of a surplus of... shall we say, fanatical followers lately, ones who grow restless by the day. They've already started a few fights with random citizens they proclaim to be "nonbelievers."'
1.Gather these fanatics and arm them. Declare that they are to be the 'Guardians of our Religion,' and task them with the crucifiction of all who stand against the crown. @The High Priestess frowned at the order. 'As you command, my liege,' she said finally, clearly in disagreement with your decision.
2.Kill them all, and do it quietly. Fanatics cannot be controlled. @'That was my thought as well, Your Grace,' the High Priestess said with a nod of approval. 'I'll see to it.' (Population-15)
3.Do nothing. I see no problem with passionate followers. @The High Priestess frowned at the order. 'I... don't see how that will help, but...,' she sighed, realizing she could not argue with you. 'So be it, but this is a bad idea, Your Grace.'
|
<1-1=5[1]>1-1=6:High Priestess:'Greetings, my liege,' The High Priestess said. 'I have news concerning the "Guardians of our Religion." That group of fanatical warriors you had me initiate?' she asked, her tone dripping with accusation. 'They've just killed ten women in a brothel. They've been arrested, but claim their actions were justified, saying that the women were...,' she cleared her throat before continuing, '"unclean whores," undeserving of living on the same soil as them.' (Population-10)
1.Release them. They're doing God's work. @'Are you serious?' The High Priestess asked in disbelief, completely taken aback by your command. 'If this is God's work, then I am no longer his servant,' she said in anger before spinning around and marching out the throne room. 'Find a new High Priestess to do "God's work,"' she cursed as she left.
2.Keep them imprisoned and disband them. @'A wise choice, Your Grace,' the High Priestess said.
3.Kill them. They've gone too far this time. @'A wise choice, Your Grace,' the High Priestess said. 'I would have made the same call.'
|
1-2=1:Alistair Kyntha, The Hand of The King:'Your Grace, there are five rough looking men at the castle gate. Mercenaries, by the looks of them. They want employement, and they don't look like they'll take no for an answer.'
1.They can either leave unemployed, or die where they stand. @'A wise decision, Your Grace,' The Hand said, sighing relievedly. 'Mercenaries cannot be trusted.'
2.<Gold;10>Find a task for them. We may as well make use of them. @'I'll see to it,' The Hand said before turning to give the order. (Gold-10)
3.Offer them citizenship in exchange for their joining our military. We can always use the extra men. @'I'll see they get the offer, Your Grace,' The Hand said, though it was clear he didn't approve. (Population+5)
|
<1-2=1[2]>1-2=2:Alistair Kyntha, The Hand of The King:'Your Grace,' The Hand greeted, 'I have news. I tasked the mercenaries we hired with hunting a band of criminals who've been causing us some trouble. Simply put, they won't trouble us anymore.' (Faith+10)
1.Good, but escort the mercenaries from the kingdom. We have enough trouble here as is. @'I understand, Your Grace,' The Hand said in approval. 'They cannot be trusted. Men who fight for gold don't hold a candle to those who fight for the sake of their kingdom.'
2.Offer them citizenship in exchange for their joining our military. We can always use the extra men. @'I'll see they get the offer, Your Grace,' The Hand said, though it was clear he didn't approve of your choice. (Population+5)
|
1-3=1:Ser Alaric, Leader of the Guards:'Your Grace, we've captured what we believe to be a spy,' Ser Alaric announced. 'We think he's from one of the domains that share our border, the Kingdom of Eldoria. He was caught trying to sneak into the Royal Palace.'
1.Torture him for information. See what you can find, and do it quick. @'Yes, my lord,' Ser Alaric said without any sign of reservation. 'I'll get to the bottom of it, I swear it.'
2.Have him imprisoned. Time in the cell might make him talk. @'Yes, my lord,' Ser Alaric said.
3.Release him. @'Your Grace?' Ser Alaric asked, suddenly confused. 'That doesn't seem wise, but... Very well. Your word is law, after all.'
|
<1-3=1[1]>1-3=2:Ser Alaric, Leader of the Guards:'Your Grace, I have an update on the situation with the Eldorian spy,' Alaric said, a hint of nervousness in his tone. 'He lasted longer than I expected, but he finally broke. The Kingdom of Eldoria has placed a garrison not far outside our capital. Apparently, they're planning to strike.'
1.Gather the men for a surprise night assault. @'I'll see to it,' Ser Alaric said with a sudden eagerness. It had been a while since the captain of the guards had been in a battle, and the yearning for it was painted clear as day on his face.
2.<Tech;2>I'll not waste men on an assault. Launch barrels of flaming pitch at them. @'I'll contact the alchemists,' Ser Alaric said. 'They'll burn as they leave this life, and then they'll keep burning in hell.'
3.Place the capital on high alert. I want us to be completely fortified in the case of an assault. @'I'll see to it,' Ser Alaric said, seeming unsatisfied with your decision.
|
<1-3=1[2]>1-3=3:Ser Alaric, Leader of the Guards:'Your Grace, I have an update on the situation with the Eldorian spy. He...,' he started, hesitating. 'A guard just found him. He hung himself in his cell. Whatever reason he had for coming to our kingdom died with him.'
1.Mount his head on a spike outside the capital's gate. @'Yes, my lord,' Ser Alaric said without any sign of reservations. 'It'll be a warning to any who think to oppose us.' (Faith-5)
2.Have him buried in an unmarked grave. @'Yes, my lord,' Ser Alaric said. 'Though, if you don't mind my saying, scum like him don't deserve a proper burial. If it was my choice, I'd have fed him to the hounds.'
|
{1-3=2[1]}1-3=4:Ser Alaric, Leader of the Guards:'Your Grace,' Ser Alaric panted after running into the throne room, his armour slick with blood. The battle must have only just ended. 'The night assault on the Eldorian garrison... it was a success! We took them completely by surprise. Most were killed or taken prisoner, but there was a scholar amoung them who offered you his allegiance for his life. I only mention him because he was the only one we captured with a worthy trade.'
1.Accept his offer. We could use more brainpower, but watch him closely. @'Understood, Your Grace,' Ser Alaric said, still breathing heavily from the recently finished battle. (Population+1)
2.I'll not take in an enemy, even one that bears a mask of innocence. Execute him or send him away, the choice is yours. @'Understood, Your Grace,' Ser Alaric said, still breathing heavily from the recently finished battle. 'He could have been of use, but it's probably safer this way.'
|
{1-3=2[2]}1-3=5:Ser Alaric, Captain of the Guards:'Your Grace,' Ser Alaric panted after running into the throne room, his armour slick with blood. The battle must have only just ended. 'The assault on the Eldorian garrison... it was a success! The pitch worked wonders. Actually, it worked a little too well. We couldn't take prisoners, since the entire garrison was reduced to ash.'
1.You did well, Alaric. @'Thank you, Your Grace,' he said, still out of breath.
|
{1-3=2[3]}1-3=6:Ser Alaric, Captain of the Guards:'Your Grace!' the captain shouted after suddenly running into the throne room, his armour slick with blood. 'There's just been an assault. The Kingdom of Eldoria attacked us! It was a small force, and we managed to defeat them, but...,' he paused, his tone suddenly sombre, 'there were heavy losses on our side.'
1.You did well, Alaric. @'Thank you, Your Grace,' he said, still out of breath. 'It was only thanks to your setting the capital on high alert that we were able to react as quickly as we did. You made the right call.'
|
<1-3=4[1]>1-3=7:Dr. Elend:'Your Grace,' the captive Eldorian scientist greeted with a slight bow. 'I've made a discovery. It has the potential to change everything about the way we view...' He suddenly stopped himself, realizing he was trailing on. 'I'm not sure I could properly explain the details to you, but this discovery will put you and your kingdom ahead by decades of technological advancement. Not even the Empire of The Sun knows of what I've just discovered.' (Tech+5)
1.You did well, doctor. I'll make you an official citizen of my kingdom for this. @The doctor's face dropped slightly at the words. 'Um... Yes, Your Grace,' he said, clearly underwhelmed. 'Thank you,' he added a moment later. (Population+1)
2.<Gold;20>I'll see you're well reinbursed for your discovery, doctor. @'Thank you, Your Grace,' the doctor said with as much gratitude as a hostage could, though he did seem genuinely grateful for the gold. 'I'll continue the work,' he added. 'Scientific inquiry is a curious thing. It never seems to end.' (Gold-20)
|
<1-3=7[2]>1-3=8:Dr. Elend:'I've made a discovery,' the Eldorian scientist announced. Though not technically a citizen, Dr. Elend was paid well and lived in the capital where he continued his research. It seemed that so long as he had a steady stream of resources and gold, he was happy to work for his enemies. 'It has to do with something called the “Arcane." That force that seems to defy the natural laws of physics. I believe I've found a way to detect it, and I'm working on a device that will even be able to create it in its raw form.' (Tech+3)
1.<Gold;20>Good work, doctor. Keep up the work. @'I will, Your Grace.' (Gold-20)
2.You'll have to do better than that if you want to keep getting paid, doctor. @Dr. Elend frowned. 'Your Grace? If this is discovery isn't good enough, then I don't know what is. This will, quite literally, shift our entire paradigm. We'll be forced to rethink physics, math, the essence of the world. What more do you want from me?'
|
1-4=1:Counsellor Bahtia:'Your Grace,' the counsellor greeted, 'I come to ask you to consider the issue of the kingdom's taxes. Your father was rather lax with them, and we have suffered for it. I ask that you, our new ruler, increase the tax rate and put the gold to good use. It's for the good of the kingdom, of course.'
1.Very well, but I'll not lift a finger. You can handle the matter personally. @Counsellor Bahtia smiled at your acceptance of his ask. It was a greedy smile, one that betrayed a deeply rooted insatiable hunger. 'I will do as Your Grace commands,' he said, bowing before you subserviently. (Gold+100)
2.I'll not risk the support of the people over coin. We can get gold in other ways, councellor. @Counsellor Bahtia only sighed, knowing that further argument with you was pointless.
|
<1-4=1[2]>1-4=2:Counsellor Bahtia:'My request is a simple one, Your Grace. I only ask that you reconsider your decision concerning the raising of taxes. Yes, it decreases popular support, but the gold we gain is well worth it, I assure you.'
1.Very well. I won't deny that we don't need the gold. @Counsellor Bahtia smiled at your acceptance of his offer. It was a greedy smile, one that betrayed a deeply rooted insatiable hunger. 'I will do as Your Grace commands,' he said, bowing before you subserviently. (Gold+100)
2.I refused you once, and you come crawling back like some street beggar. This behavior does not befit your station, Bahtia. Perhaps I should have you replaced. @The counsellor's eyes went wide at your remark. 'Your Grace, I appologize,' he said in a shocked stutter. He wasted no time bowing and turning to shuffle out of the throne room. (Faith+5)
|
<1-4=1[1]>1-4=3:Alistair Kyntha, The Hand of The King:'Your Grace,' The Hand greeted, a slight nervous concern on his face. 'There's a gathering in the capital square. It's about the raising of taxes. The people aren't very happy with you, to put it lightly, but it hasn't fallen to violence. At least not yet.' (Faith-15)
1.Taxes are the price of living under the protection of a kingdom. Contact Councellor Bahtia, and order him to raise the taxes higher. I will not suffer disobedience! @The Hand frowned at your outburst, but did not speak out against you. He simply left and went to complete his task. (Gold+100)
2.Let them protest, but they will not have their way. @'Understood, Your Grace,' The Hand said, showing no sign or agreement of disagreement with your decision.
|
{1-4=3[2]}1-4=4:Alistair Kyntha, The Hand of The King:'The protest against the taxes ended, Your Grace,' The Hand announced. 'It took some time, but the unrest eventually died down. The new tax rate will hold. They won't be happy, but they won't fight you.' (Faith-10)
1.Good. There shouldn't have been this much of a fight to begin with. @The Hand nodded. 'Agreed, but this is simply the nature of being a ruler. Your father knew that, and he ruled for a long time because of it. There's still a lot you could learn from him, you know.'
|
{1-4=3[1]}1-4=5:Alistair Kyntha, The Hand of The King:'Your Grace, we have a problem,' The Hand announced as he strode into the throne room, his expression deadly serious. 'It's about the protest in the capital square. When they heard about your decision to raise the taxes higher, they started marching toward the castle. They're here now, calling for change.' As The Hand waited for an answer from you, he suddenly added, 'If it comes to violence, and I pray it does not, but the castle garrison stands strong. We'd be safe.' (Faith-30)
1.Kill them all! And triple the tax rate! I will not suffer insubordination! @The Hand frowned, narrowing his eyes as if he couldn't believe what you had just said. 'Your Grace? That's... This isn't the time for pushing the people further. I was Hand to your father long enough to know that much about ruling. This won't end well, but...' After a moment of consideration, he finally said, 'If this is your decision, then so be it, but the blame will be yours if this goes badly.' (Gold+300)
2.Give them some gold as a peace offering. Not enough to undo our tax income, but enough to end the gathering. @'A compromise. Good idea,' The Hand said before turning to go do as he was bid. (Gold-50)
|
{1-4=5[1]}1-4=6:Alistair Kyntha, The Hand of The King:'Your Grace!' The Hand called as he strode into the throne room. 'It was bloody work, but the protest was put down. We...,' he paused, as if he couldn't believe what he was about to say. 'The men... started killing them, as you ordered, but many got away. More than we can chase down. Once news gets out about this, we'll be in serious trouble, Your Grace. We need to make a move, before the people do.' (Population-100)
1.It's civil war, then! Kill them all, Alistair. I'd sooner rule over a kingdom of corpses then a kingdom of peasants who refuse to obey their king. @The Hand looked at you in disgust. 'I'd ask if you were only jesting, but I can see it in your eyes. You're serious, and that's what scares me the most.' The Hand suddenly sighed deeply, eyes closed, as if he had finally come to a conclusion he had been debating for a while. 'I'll give the order to the men, Your Grace, but that's the last order I'll ever give. I'm done,' he said, removing the golden pin at his breast, the symbol of the king's hand, and tossing it at your feet. 'I thought you were like your father, way back when you first took the throne. Oh how wrong I was.'
2.Cover it up. Clean up the mess of corpses outside the castle. Hunt the ones who got away, but quietly. Spread conflicting rumours through the populace of what may have happened today, but paint us in a good light. @'A good call, Your Grace,' The Hand said approvingly. 'There's not much we could do to get out of this situation, but I think that might actually work.'
|
{1-4=6[1]}1-4=7:Counsellor Bahtia, Hand Regent:You had expected to see the Hand of the King, Alistair Kyntha, enter the throne room, but it was only Bahtia, the Hand Regent. He was temperarily filling the position until someone more fit to the role could be found. 'Your Grace,' he greeted. 'What now?'
1.We rule. @'What?' Bahtia asked, looking incredibly confused. 'After Alistair abandoned his post, you came to me and ordered me to follow you here, to this field in the middle of nowhere. This is Eldoria, is it not?' he asked, turning from you and staring distantly at the walls of the throne room. 'You can't deny that view though. The colours of the setting sun, so beautiful...,' Bahtia added to himself in thought. What view was he talking about that was worth bringing up, even in thought? He was just looking at a stone wall. Bahtia turned back, looking at you expectantly. 'Your Grace, what did you mean when you said "we rule?"' When you didn't answer, he simply shook his head, turning back to face the wall, looking distantly at it, as if he could see past it somehow. 'We really should be getting back to our kingdom.' (Population-100000000)
|
{1-4=6[2]}1-4=8:Alistair Kyntha, The Hand of The King:'I believe your plan worked, Your Grace,' The Hand announced as he strode into the throne room. 'There was an inital burst of unrest from the onset of the chaos those rumours wrought, but it's calmed down. The people were too confused to join together and take action. We're safe, but I wouldn't say the people are happy. Most haven't forgotten about the taxes.' (Faith-50)
1.Understood. Let's get back to work, then. No time to waste. @The Hand nodded in agreement. 'Yes, Your Grace. I'll continue working at keeping the people from rebelling. And you... Well, just don't start a revolution.'
|
<Population;500>1-5=1:Cloaked Figure:'Your Grace,' the cloaked figure greeted in a voice that was soft, yet deadly sharp. There was a strange power to his words, as if they took form and reached out toward you, grasping your soul in an almighty grip and forcing you to give them your entire, unwavering focus, so much so that everything else seemed to drown away. 'I propose a trade,' the figure continued, interupting your strange focus on his tone. 'You crave gold, and I crave Investiture. We both have what the other wants. So, what say you?'
1.I accept, though I must first ask what you mean by Investiture. @The cloaked figure smiled at your acceptance of his offer. 'You need not worry about your part of the deal. I'll gather the Investiture myself,' the figure said simply before turning to leave. (Gold+400)
2.I refuse. Speak plainly next time, and I might reconsider. @'Very well, but we will meet again,' the figure said mysteriously before taking his leave.
|
<1-5=1[1]>1-5=2:Alistair Kyntha, The Hand of The King:'Your Grace,' The Hand greeted. 'I have news concerning the deal you made with that... thing,' he started. 'I know he wanted Investiture in return, and he said he would gather it himself, but... I think I've just found the real cost of that deal. There've been multiple reports of missing persons, nineteen so far.' (Population-25)
1.A few people are well worth the gold we got from that deal. It's probably better we forget it and move on. @'Understood, Your Grace,' The Hand said. 'It's probably for the best.' 
2.Start a search for the cloaked man. I want answers. @'Understood, Your Grace,' The Hand said. 'He has a lot to answer for.'
|
<1-5=5[2]>1-5=12:Alistair Kyntha, The Hand of The King:'I have a report on the search for the cloaked figure,' The Hand started, his tone indicating that it wasn't good news. 'We haven't found him, Your Grace. Only more corpses. The ones we sent looking for him.' (Population-10)
1.Stop the search, then. It's clear we aren't getting anywhere. @'Understood, Your Grace,' The Hand said. 'It's probably for the best.'
|
<1-5=1[2]>1-5=6:Cloaked Figure:'My offer remains the same, Your Grace,' the cloaked figure said in that soft, piercing voice of his. 'Gold for Investiture. I will not ask you again.'
1.I accept, though I must first ask what you mean by Investiture. @The cloaked figure smiled at your acceptance of his offer. 'You need not worry about your part of the deal. I'll gather the Investiture myself,' the figure said simply before turning to leave. (Gold+400)
2.I refuse. @'So be it,' the cloaked figure said. His tone was perfectly neutral, yet the soul piercing, essence gripping words of his forced raw , pure feelings of hatred and repulsion. By the time the feeling subsided, the figure appeared to have left. How had you not noticed his exit?
3.*give the 'purge' hand sign* @'A poor choice,' the cloaked figure said suddenly before you could even form the sign. 'I had thought you were wiser, but I was wrong,' he added, his tone dripping with disapointment as he turned to leave. Even after he was gone, his words seemed to leave an imprint on your soul.
|
<1-5=6[1]>1-5=7:Alistair Kyntha, The Hand of The King:'Your Grace,' The Hand greeted. 'I have news concerning the deal you made with that... thing,' he started. 'I know he wanted Investiture in return, and he said he would gather it himself, but... I think I've just found the real identity of the cost of that deal. There've been multiple reports of missing persons since your deal, nineteen so far.' (Population-25)

{1-5=6[3]}1-5=9:Nobody:You were supposed to have a meeting with Alistair Kyntha, The Hand, yet he wasn't here. Looking around the throne room, you realized that the guards were also gone. The throne room was completely empty. Silent. It was strange. Where had everyone gone? And why had you not noticed their absence? How long had you been sitting here? When did you even enter this room? When had that happened? You couldn't seem to remember. Why couldn't you remember? Why? The routine, you realized, was the problem. It changed. There was supposed to be a hearing in the throne room, and then another, and then another and another and another and another and another, never ending, never ceasing, and yet, paradoxically, continuously repeating over and over and over until...
1.*stand up from throne and investigate* @ 
|
{1-5=9[1]}1-5=10:Nobody:Standing up from the golden throne you always made your decisions on, you started walking through the eerily silent halls that were normally filled with people, yet weren't. Where was everybody? As you came upon the castle entrance's front gate, you found it slightly open, a thin line of light pouring onto the adjacent wall. 'Are you sure you want to open that?' a voice suddenly asked from behind you. Turning toward it, you found the cloaked figure standing at the other end of the hall, maybe fifty metres away. 'The choice is yours,' the figure added as if everything were normal. 'It's always been yours, hasn't it?' he added with a sombre sigh. 'Some are easy, some are hard, but one thing remains true. They define us. It doesn't matter what you think you know or what you think you would do in a situation. The only thing that truly determines who you are is the actions you take. The choices you make.' What was the figure saying? What was this even about? And why were you strangely captivated by his words? Ahh, yes, his words. They carried power, that was why. But how? 'I see the gears turning in your head, but you won't find the answers there.' Turning away from the cloaked figure, you set your eyes on the partly open door. What was behind it? 'Now you understand,' the figure said, his voice echoing toward you from behind. 'Take a look. I know you want to.'
1.*open the door* @ 
|
{1-5=10[1]}1-5=11:Nobody:As you opened the door, you were greeted with the familiar sight of your kingdom's capital, entirely familiar to you. The words of the mysterious figure made you doubt that this would be the sight that greeted you upon opening the door, yet here it was, exactly the same. But... something did feel off. It was the same offness you felt from the throne room, and these halls you stood in. It had an aura of hollowness. It was void of the usual hubbub that dominated this place, this place that you were so intimately familiar with. 'What is Investiture?' the figure suddenly asked from behind you. 'I drained all of it from your kingdom, and that's why things are the way they are. So tell me, what is Investiture?'
1.It's life. @'In a way,' the figure said, except this time his words began gripping your soul tighter in its grasp, as it had done before. It was different from before, though. More aggressive. More passionate. More feral. You could almost hear your soul screaming out in agony. 'Investiture is what gives life to the inanimate,' the figure continued, each syllable another knife cutting into your soul, shredding it to ribbons and then shredding those ribbons to ribbons and on and on until it seemed like nothing would be left, but you were still here. 'Without Investiture, the extent of our body's importance would be the chemicals that make it up, but we are more than just the flesh and bone we experience reality through. Every living thing has Investiture. Or, I should say, everything you would consider as having a soul has Investiture, but humans have more than most. That's mostly due to our advanced intelligence. However, I'm unique in that I can absorb Investiture through use of Voice, and can command foreign Investiture to my body, but those particulars aren't important. There's simply no point wasting time explaining something to the dead and gone.' Those were the last words you ever heard before being taken by the void. (Population-100000000)

{1-5=3[1]}1-5=4:Nobody:Standing up from the golden throne you always made your decisions on, you started walking through the eerily silent halls that were normally filled with people, yet weren't. Where was everybody? As you came upon the castle entrance's front gate, you found it slightly open, a thin line of light pouring onto the adjacent wall. 'Are you sure you want to open that?' a voice suddenly asked from behind you. Turning toward it, you found the cloaked figure standing at the other end of the hall, maybe fifty metres away. 'The choice is yours,' the figure added as if everything were normal. 'It's always been yours, hasn't it?' he added with a sombre sigh. 'Some are easy, some are hard, but one thing remains true. They define us. It doesn't matter what you think you know or what you think you would do in a situation. The only thing that truly determines who you are is the actions you take. The choices you make.' What was the figure saying? What was this even about? And why were you strangely captivated by his words? Ahh, yes, his words. They carried power, that was why. But how? 'I see the gears turning in your head, but you won't find the answers there.' Turning away from the cloaked figure, you set your eyes on the partly open door. What was behind it? 'Now you understand,' the figure said, his voice echoing toward you from behind. 'Take a look. I know you want to.'
1.*open the door* @ 
|
{1-5=4[1]}1-5=5:Nobody:As you opened the door, you were greeted with the familiar sight of your kingdom's capital, entirely familiar to you. The words of the mysterious figure made you doubt that this would be the sight that greeted you upon opening the door, yet here it was, exactly the same. But... something did feel off. It was the same offness you felt from the throne room, and these halls you stood in. It had an aura of hollowness. It was void of the usual hubbub that dominated this place, this place that you were so intimately familiar with. 'What is Investiture?' the figure suddenly asked from behind you. 'I drained all of it from your kingdom, and that's why things are the way they are. So tell me, what is Investiture?'
1.It's life. @'In a way,' the figure said, except this time his words began gripping your soul tighter in its grasp, as it had done before. It was different from before, though. More aggressive. More passionate. More feral. You could almost hear your soul screaming out in agony. 'Investiture is what gives life to the inanimate,' the figure continued, each syllable another knife cutting into your soul, shredding it to ribbons and then shredding those ribbons to ribbons and on and on until it seemed like nothing would be left, but you were still here. 'Without Investiture, the extent of our body's importance would be the chemicals that make it up, but we are more than just the flesh and bone we experience reality through. Every living thing has Investiture. Or, I should say, everything you would consider as having a soul has Investiture, but humans have more than most. That's mostly due to our advanced intelligence. However, I'm unique in that I can absorb Investiture through use of Voice, and can command foreign Investiture to my body, but those particulars aren't important. There's simply no point wasting time explaining something to the dead and gone.' Those were the last words you ever heard before being taken by the void. (Population-100000000)

<Faith;15>1-6=1:Alistair Kyntha, The Hand of The King:'Your Grace, we have an issue,' The Hand started. 'One of our patrols was found in an ally, all of them dead. There's also been talk of revolt amoung the populace. People aren't happy with the way you've been ruling, and there's lots of talk about how everything was better when your father held the crown. If we don't take action, we'll have a revolution on our hands.' (Population-5)
1.I will not suffer revolt. Put it down by force. @'Very well, Your Grace,' The Hand started, 'but... Well, this will be a bloody affair.'
2.<Gold;100>This is a delicate situation, and it requires a delicate hand. Hire an Arbiter from the Empire of The Sun. @The Hand frowned. 'An Arbiter, Your Grace?' he asked, confused. 'Well, they are good at what they do,' Alistair admitted after a moment of quiet consideration. 'I'll see that it gets done.' (Gold-100)
3.I will do nothing. Let them take their anger out on the occasional patrol. It'll die out. @The Hand frowned. 'Your Grace, is that... wise? If you ask me, this is not something to be ignored and brushed to the side,' he added. It only took one look at you for him to realize you weren't going to change your mind. 'So be it, Your Grace,' he said with a sigh. 'We'll let it run it's course.'
|
{1-6=1[1]}1-6=2:Alistair Kyntha, The Hand of The King:'Your Grace,' The Hand greeted hastily as he entered the throne room. 'The revolution. It's been put down by force, as you've asked, but we've suffered for it. Twenty of our men dead, thrice that injured, and that's not even accounting for the casualties suffered by the revolutionaries and the bystanders. The capital's on fire. It's a living hell down there,' he said, exhaling deeply after delivering his lengthy report. 'We must take action.' (Population-40)
1.<Gold;150>Deliver aid and food to the people. Go as deeply into the royal treasury as you must. Just restore the peace. @'A wise move, Your Grace,' The Hand said approvingly. 'I'll see it gets done.' (Gold-150)
2.The situation has already been handled, from what I can tell. I refuse to lose more resources to this mess. @The Hand sighed. 'I guess there isn't much we can do now. The revolution has died out, so we're free from any risk of uprising. At least for now.'
|
{1-6=2[1]}1-6=5:Alistair Kyntha, The Hand of The King:'The medical aid and food. It worked, Your Grace,' The Hand said, everything about him radiating relief. 'The people are thankful to you. Those that weren't a part of the revolution, at least. They seem to understand the need to take force. From what I can tell, most of them were coerced into joining that revolution, anyway.' (Faith+20)
1.Understood. Let's get back to work, then. @The Hand nodded in agreement. 'Yes, Your Grace. Of course.'
|
{1-6=1[2]}1-6=3:Alistair Kyntha, The Hand of The King:'Your Grace,' The Hand greeted as he entered the throne room. 'The revolution. It's been sorted,' he said with a relieved sigh. 'I must admit that I had my doubts when you chose to hire an Arbiter, but it worked wonders. The unrest died practically overnight.' The Hand became suddenly silent, as though he had just had a realization. 'Though, I must admit, even with the success, I don't know how to feel about... those things,' he said, his voice dripping with repulsion at the word "things." (Faith+40)
1.Agreed, but everything worked out, despite the... particulars of the Arbitrilaria. @'Those things are dangerous,' The Hand concurred. 'If only we had access to the secrets of the Empire of The Sun,' he added softly to himself in pondering thought.
|
{1-6=1[3]}1-6=4:Alistair Kyntha, The Hand of The King:'Your Grace! The revolution. It's started, and it's become greater than we could have ever anticipated. They're gathering outside the castle. The mob is so large it's overwhelming the garrison!' The Hand cried, giving way to the panic that was tearing at him. Never had he ever been in such a dire situation under your father. 'They're calling for your head,' The Hand added after recomposing himself. (Faith-20)
1.Silence, you fool! We will endure. They will not slay their king. @The Hand looked at you as if you were suddenly a stranger. 'Endure? Don't play the fool, Your Grace. We've lost. I've half the mind to grab you and toss you into that mob myself. It was you who led us to this, after all. I trusted you, and now I see the image of you in my head did not match the reality,' he said accusingly. Finally, The Hand sat down on the throne room floor, a clear sign that he had given up. 'We've lost,' Alistair said simply. 'It's a simple fact. Denial won't change our reality. Denial won't change the fact that the only reason we're in this situation is because you failed to make the right call, and that you failed to be a good king.' (Population-100000000)
2.*give the 'regicide' hand sign* There's only one thing left to do. @One of your guards, despite seeming incredibly reluctant to do his duty at the sight of your hand sign, did not falter to unsheath his sword and slash your neck. It was a clean, swift cut, one that you could barely even feel as you fell forward, blood pooring out onto the floor in front of you. There was no hesitation in the guard's strike, and there was no hate either. It was an action set off purely by your hand sign, and it had been obeyed without spoken reservations. Despite everything, that guard still had complete faith in you. That was something you could pride yourself on, at least. He was loyal and obeisant to the end. (Population-100000000)

1-7=1:Dr Kynes, Independent Scholar:'Your Grace,' the foreign scholar greeted with a bow. 'I come with a simple proposition. Gold in exchange for knowledge of the sciences. The Empire of The Sun keeps their secrets well hidden. The Arbitrilaria and their hollow human mimics they call Arbiters, Plasteel, that strange shimmering metal, stronger than any ever discovered, the Las...,' the scholar paused, realizing he was droning on. 'I have one of their secrets I wish to offer you,' he said after recomposing himself, 'in exchange for gold, of course. It's a research sheet outlining how to create the Sun Empire's purplish luminescent powder, Dreamsand. I stole it after defecting from an imperial research facility.'
1.<Gold;40>Very well, I accept. @'It's a pleasure doing business with you,' the scholar said, smiling at your acceptance of his trade offer. (Gold-40)
2.I have no need of imperial research papers. @A hint of disapointment flashed across the doctor's face. 'That's a shame, perhaps I'll have better luck with the King of Eldoria,' the doctor added, spitefulness in his tone, as he turned to leave.
3.*give the 'purge' hand sign* I think I'll just take the sheet off your corpse. @At the sign, one of your guards took his sword out and slashed the doctor's throat, leaving him laying dead dead on the floor. The rhythmic outpoor of blood from his neck slowly spread out from his corpse, covering the throne room and filling the air with the scent of iron. After a quick search from your guards, they found the research sheet hidden away inside the doctor's jacket. (Tech+5)
|
<1-7=1[1]>1-7=5:Master Crafter Silas:'I've analysed the Dreamsand research sheet you bought,' the Master Crafter started. 'It's not a forgery, I'll say that much. I understand how to make it, though it took me a while. The empire's dialect is very loaded and nuance you see. The effect of the Dreamsand on our technological advancement is complete, but there's an opportunity here, Your Grace. I have the means to start producing it en mass. We could sell it to nearby kingdoms who are also eager for the Empire of The Sun's secrets. There's a lot of gold to be made, through that route. (Tech+5)
1.We'll keep it for ourselves. Those kingdoms are our enemies, and I won't have any part in aiding them reach new technologial advancement. I'd also rather avoid inciting the Empire's wrath. You know how petty they can be. @'Understood, Your Grace,' the Master Crafter said before making to leave.
2.<Gold;150>Build a factory and start production as soon as possible. And while you're at it, find a buyer for the product. @The Master Crafter smiled. 'I had hoped you would say that, Your Grace.' (Gold-150)
|
<1-7=5[2]>1-7=6:Master Crafter Silas:'I've been in contact with many of the more trustworthy kingdoms, Your Grace, searching for potential buyers for the Dreamsand we've been producing,' the Master Crafter started. 'Don't worthy, I've been discrete. The Empire won't be hearing of our affairs. The Kingdom of Lastella has made me an offer. They're a rich kingdom, Your Grace, and they seem to hold an extreme loathing of the Sun Empire. It's the best deal we're bound to get.'
1.Make the deal. @The Master Crafter smiled. 'Yes, Your Grace. I'll see to it.' (Gold+500)
2.Actually, cancel the deal. This was a bad idea. @The Master Crafter frowned. 'Your Grace? But, the production plant has already been built. You want us to turn back now that we've come this far?' When you didn't respond, Silas sighed. 'So be it, Your Grace.'

<1-7=1[1]>1-7=2:Adonis, Imperial Inquisitor:'I greet you, O' ruler of this domain,' the strangely spoken inquisitor greeted coldly. It was clear he did not want to be here. 'I am hunting a man, Dr Kynes, an enemy of our glorious Empire of the Sun. I know he passed through your land, and I must know if you have seen or heard of him.'
1.*truth* He did come through here. I traded him gold for an imperial research sheet he possessed. @The inquisitor narrowed his eyes as he listened to you. 'A truth,' he said finally, though he still seemed suspicious, as if he expected you to lie. 'Your honesty is appreciated, O' ruler. The damage of the Dreamsand paper being in your possession has already been done, then, and so the Empire of The Sun will not take action against you. Good day,' the inquisitor said before spinning around and making to leave.
2.*lie* I know of no Dr Kynes. @The inquisitor scowled. 'A lie! He was here, lying creature! I can tell by microinflections of your voice,' he added, but visibly calmed himself at the sight of the guards in the throne room moving to grip their swords in their sheaths. The inquisitor gritted hit teeth. 'You are lucky my search for Dr Kynes is not more important than this domain you rule over, O' liar ruler,' he said before spinning around and marching from the throne room.

I shall continue my search elsewhere,' the inquisitor said before spinning around and making to leave.

{Gold;30}1-8=1:Aliana Salua, Imperial Banker:'Your Grace,' the banker greeted, bowing before you. 'I have heard disturbing rumours concerning the financial situation of your kingdom, and the state of your royal treasury. The Ardent Bank would be more than willing to offer you a sum of gold to help in these troubled times. You would, of course, have to pay us back with interest in the future.'
1.I accept your offer. @'Our rates are quite generous, I think,' the banker added, a satisfied smile forming at her lips. She had come here for the specific purpose of forcing your kingdom into a deal, and she had completed it. 'We will see each other again,' she added before making her leave. (Gold+800)
2.I refuse. The state of our treasury is a matter of our own, and a private one at that. What I would like to know is where you got your information. @The Imperial Banker smiled. It was probably a habit, build by decades of charisma intensive work. 'The Ardent Bank has its ways,' she said vaguely. Changing the subject, she added, 'If you change your mind, we will always be open to bargain.' Before making her leave, she dropped two glittering golden coins, freshly cut, by the look of them, onto the throne room floor.
|
<1-8=1[1]>1-8=2:Aliana Salua, Imperial Banker:'Your Grace,' the banker greeted, bowing before you in mock subservience. 'The time has come to repay the dept you owe the Ardent Bank. I believe the agreed amount was twelve hundred gold pieces.'
1.<Gold;1200>There was no agreed amount. It was left vague, if I recall. Still, I'll pay. @The banker smiled greedily as the gold was presented to her. 'It's been a pleasure.' (Gold-1200)
2.*give the 'purge' hand sign* There will be no repaying of depts. @At the hand sign, the guard unsheathed his sword and slashed the banker's neck with a quick, clean cut. On her corpse, you found an obsidian piece, incredibly rare, and incredibly valuable. (Gold+30)
3.And if I don't want to pay it back? @The imperial banker looked at you with confusion. 'You are aware of what happens when a client does not pay, are you not?' The question was rhetorical, of course. Everyone knew that to go against the imperial bank was to go against the Empire itself. It was to declare war, yet you stood your ground. 'The Empire will hear of this,' Aliana said after realizing you were being serious. Once she was gone, you looked over to Alistair Kyntha, standing idly to the right of the throne. 'They'll come for you, Your Grace,' The Hand said. 'If I were you, I'd chase that woman and beg her forgiveness. One does not defy the Empire of The Sun.' His words went right over your head.
|
<1-8=1[2]>1-8=3:Aliana Salua, Imperial Banker:'Your Grace,' the banker greeted, bowing before you. 'I have returned, once again to ask if you would be willing to take a loan. To speak plainly, your situation is dire, Your Grace. Do not let pride get in the way of progress.'
1.Very well. I must admit I am in desperate need of gold. @'Our rates are quite generous, I think,' the banker added, a satisfied smile forming at her lips. She had come here for the specific purpose of forcing your kingdom into a deal, and she had completed it. 'We will see each other again,' she added before making her leave. (Gold+800)
2.I have refused you once, and now I am refusing again. Do not test me a third time. @At your words, the look on confidence on the banker's face faded to a scowl as she bit  her tongue. 'How dare they take that tone with me,' she said under her breath as she marched out of the throne room.

{1-8=2[3]}1-8=5:Alistair Kyntha, The Hand of The King:'Your Grace!' The Hand called as he marched into the throne room. 'It's the Empire of The Sun. They're already here, at our door! Two hundred imperials just up and marched into the capital. They're making their way here!'
1.<Gold;1300>Pay the gold the bank demanded from us, and throw in some extra. I didn't expect the bank to move so quickly. @'Yes, Your Grace,' The Hand said, relieved by your choice. 'We should have payed the banker when she was here, but this will have to do.' (Gold-1300)
2.They expect me to be scared over two hundred men? Attack them! @'Yes, Your Grace,' The Hand said hesitantly. In any other circumstance he would have opposed your choice, but it only took one look in your eye to see you would not back down. 'I'll contact Ser Alaric and have him round up the men.'
|
{1-8=5[1]}1-8=6:Alistair Kyntha, The Hand of The King:'They took it, Your Grace,' The Hand announced. 'The imperials took the gold and left. For a moment, it seemed like they were going to try attacking us anyway, but they backed down. Aliana Salua was with them as well, Your Grace. She said...,' he paused taking a moment to catch his breath. 'She said the bank was closed to us indefinitely, and that we were to be blacklisted from all foreign affairs concerning the Empire of The Sun.'
1.Understood. Make sure all the imperials leave. You know how they are with planting spies in kingdoms they perceive as hostile. @'Yes, Your Grace,' The Hand said, sighing with relief. 'I'll have Ser Alaric take a look into it.'
|
{1-8=5[2]}1-8=10:Ser Alaric, Captain of the Guards:'We won,' Alaric said simply as he limped into the throne room, his armour covered in blood. He left a series of red, ferric footprints in his wake.

1-9=1:Meera Faraday, Lastellan Cultivator:'I will get straight to it, Your Grace,' the foreign cultivator said, not wasting any time with pleasantries. 'My job as a cultivator is to travel the land, giving advice to any ruler who is open to suggestion. You are still relatively new to the throne, but I can see the eagerness in your eyes. If you want to grow your domain, the most direct route is through population scaling, and an easy way to do that is by giving bursaries to any who choose to have children. It would, of course, cost you, but I've seen this route do wonders for population growth. It's worth considering.'
1.<Gold;80>The bursary program seems like a good idea. I'll implement it. @'A wise choice, Your Grace,' Meera said, happy to see her advice being taken seriously. (Gold-80)
2.Frankly, I don't see the need. @'I understand, Your Grace,' Meera said without argument. This was, after all, only a suggestion on her part, so there was no point arguing with you.
|
<1-9=1[1]>1-9=2:Meera Faraday, Lastellan Cultivator:'Your Grace, I've come with a report on your population scaling program,' the Lastellan cultivator said, a hint of cheerfulness in her tone. 'It's had a much greater effect than even I had forseen. Either way, there is still some room for improvement. All who were likely to have children are trying, but that does not mean they are actually finding any success, if you catch my meaning. The problem has a simple source. Low fertility, and the only solution I know of to help with that is by inviting followers of Tawaretta into your domain. You've heard of their small pagan religion, I'm sure. They worship a fertility goddess. It's strange, but there does seem to be a scientifically proven relationship between their presence within a population and high childbirth rates.' (Population+300)
1.<Gold;20>Very well, lure them in with gold and promises of citizenship. @'A wise choice, Your Grace,' Meera said, happy to see her advice being taken seriously. (Gold-20)
2.I don't need the help of some pagan goddess's followers. @'I understand, Your Grace,' Meera said, not seeming at all disapointed by your decision.
|
<1-9=2[1]>1-9=3:Meera Faraday, Lastellan Cultivator:'Your Grace, I've come with a report on your population scaling program,' the cultivator announced. 'The followers of Tawaretta have had the effect I hoped they would. Childbirth rates have increased dramatically since their arrival into our kindom. Your domain has grown large, Your Grace. I leave the rest to you.' (Population+150)
1.I appreciate the advice you've given me, Meera. @'And I'm glad my advice was of use,' she said, smiling at you before taking her leave.
|
<1-9=3[1]>1-9=4:Seraphina, Follower of Tawaretta:'Hello, my liege,' greeted the follower of tawaretta. They were known for their piercing amber eyes, and their calm demeaner. 'I've come to ask a favour of our new ruler. We came here at your behest, given offers of gold, but we have decided to return the gold.' You wondered where she could have gotten that idea. Now that you thought about it, it wasn't you who invited these pagans into your kingdom, but that cultivator, Meera. She must've added more incentive without telling you. Seraphina seemed suddenly angry. 'Here I thought you asked us to come here for the sake of implementing our religion into your kingdom, but it's clear to me now that that wasn't at all the case. You were using us. And that is why we will be taking our leave.'
1.<Gold;150>I intend to keep the promise I made. You'll have the ressources to build a church. @Seraphina frowned, as though your answer was unexpected. 'I see... Well, I suppose we could stay, but we followers of Tawaretta don't build churches. We build statues of bronze. Idols where anyone can come to pray, to whatever god they wish.' (Gold-150)
2.Go, then. We no longer have any use for you. @Seraphina shook her head in disgust. 'Just as I thought. Tawaretta will hear of this, I swear,' she threatened before taking her leave.
|
<1-9=4[1]>1-9=5:Meera Faraday, Lastellan Cultivator:'Your Grace,' the cultivator greeted. 'I... apologize for the situation with the Tawarettans. I should have told you I promised them an influence on your religion here, but it seems to have worked out in your favour. I've already spotted a few of their bronze idols while making the rounds of the capital. I should also mention that with the bronze statues, there's been a slight increase in fertility rates. It's small enough to be just a coincidence, but it's still relevant, I think.' (Population+30)
1.You're forgiven, but don't do anything else without my explicit permission. @She smiled thankfully. 'Of course, Your Grace.'

1-10=1:The Witch:'Lo, Your Grace,' the old blind woman greeted in a soft voice. 'I have come, O' ruler mine, wondering if you would like a reading of your future.' The use of the phrase "O' mine" suggested that this woman was from the Empire of The Sun. After all, only they spoke with such a nuanced dialect. But even so, you knew this woman. You had seen her as a child, and heard stories about her. "The witch," she was called. Thus, you knew she was local, so did she immigrate here? It seemed unlikely, though, that someone would want to leave the Empire of the Sun for what they would have labelled a "backwater kingdom." 'My viewing of your future may give you much needed insight,' the old woman continued, bringing your attention back to her. 'You, O' ruler mine, could surely benefit, if only for a small fee of gold.'
1.<Gold;5>Very well. @'I see... I see a whisp of light where a human soul should be,' the old woman began after taking your hand in hers as she gazed distantly past the wall behind your throne. 'I see a puppet controlling the hollow shell that was once my king, and I see another puppet controlling that puppet from the heavens, but... but it's not heaven. It's a void.' She suddenly took a sharp intake of breath. 'I see a black expanse, with white spots speckled across it. I see steel ships that float on a sea of nothing, propelled by the brilliant power of the sun. I see mountains of corpses across dozens of spherical domains, floating in a black, endless sky.' Her faded eyes were wide with horror at the sight. 'The corpses pile so high that the ones at the top are frozen from exposure to that cold blackness,' she continued, her voice straining and becoming increasingly distressed. 'I see the gleaming metal of the reaper's scythe as he follows quietly in your wake. I see a transgenerational fear passing down millions of genetic lines, all stemming from a single source. You. I see your foe. I see the God Emperor himself, standing proud on his own mountain of corpses that seems to trump even yours. I see you... looking in a mirror, proud, happy, and looking back at you... the God Emperor him... himself. Two sides of... of the same co... coin... I... s...' The old woman suddenly collapsed to the floor, dead from the strain of the vision that seemed to never end. (Gold-5)
2.I don't believe in prescience, witch. Be gone! @'Are you sure about that, little light?' she asked, giving you a knowing smile before turning to leave. The shock of the words "little light" prevented you from calling out to her as she left. How had she known...

1-11=1:Counsellor Bahtia:'Your Grace,' the counsellor greeted with an over the top bow. 'I've come to ask you for permission to take a sum of gold from the treasury. Our mineralogists are claiming that there's a massive gold deposit not far from the capital, and we could greatly benefit from building a mine on it. It'll cost us, but the gold we'll make in return will be well worth it.'
1.<Gold;100>The gold mine is a good idea. I'll trust you with its construction. @The counsellor smiled greedily. 'Yes, Your Grace. I'll contact Master Crafter Silas about it.' (Gold-100)
2.We have more important things to spend our resources on, counsellor. @The counsellor frowned. 'I... don't know if I agree with that, Your Grace, but...' He sighed in resignation. 'Oh very well. Your word is law.'
|
<1-11=1[1]>1-11=2:Counsellor Bahtia:'Your Grace,' the counsellor greeted with an over the top bow. 'I have a report on the gold mine you commissioned. It just finished construction, and the deposit is even larger than the mineralogists predicted. We've already begun casting the initial yield into coin.' (Gold+300)
1.Good work, counsellor. I'm glad to hear it worked out in our favour. @The counsellor smiled greedily. 'As am I, Your Grace. As am I.'
|
<1-11=2[1]>1-11=3:Counsellor Bahtia:'Your Grace,' the counsellor greeted with an over the top bow. 'I have a report on the gold mine. We've received another yield, but it seems that the deposit has been completely depleted. There're more, lesser valuable minerals to mine, but it won't be as cost efficient.' (Gold+300)
1.Keep the mine open. @'That was my thought as well,' the counsellor agreed with a nod of approval. 'There's still profit to be made here.'
2.Close the mine, then. @'This will put many out of a job, Your Grace,' the counsellor said disaprovingly, 'but so be it.' (Faith-5)

1-12=1:Cat:While waiting on your throne for the day's audience, a black cat suddenly entered the throne room, looking lost. 'Meow,' it meowed.
1.Um... Meow? @'Meow,' the cat meowed in response before turning and leisurely making its way out of the throne room. Strange that it had even been able to get this far into the castle in the first place.

{Population;600}1-13=1:Fiorella, Eldorian Princess:'Greetings,' the Eldorian princess said sweetly. Still, her tone of voice didn't explain why she was here. And without a royal escort, you noted. She had taken a few guards with her for her trip into your domain, or so The Hand told you, but why come here in the first place? She had apparently refused to explain herself until she got to meet with you. Your kingdom and hers weren't exactly friendly with each other. 'I know you're curious, Your Grace,' the princess said, reading the confusion on your face. 'What I'm about to tell you is a secret, okay? My brother, Vorin, the heir to Eldoria, has died. It was an accident, but... Well, I'm the new heir now,' she announced, though her explanation wasn't exactly clearing anything up. 'I think my father is plotting to have me killed, so that the kingdom will pass to my uncle instead of me,' she added, not seeming to realise how insane the statement was. She sighed and, after composing herself, took on a suddenly serious, pleading expression. 'I ask you, Your Grace, one royal to another, for sanctuary from my cursed father.'
1.I won't turn away someone in need, especially a royal. @The princess smiled. 'Thank you, Your Grace. I promise I won't be a bother. I can even work as a handmaid as a disguise. It'll be like I'm not even here. (Population+1)
2.Your kingdom and mine have no allegiance, and I don't care about your family's infighting. This kingdom is off limits to you. @The princess's hopeful look faded. You could tell she had been expecting this answer, but to her, who came all this way, the news must've hit hard. 'I... I understand, Your Grace,' she said sombrely. 'I'll see myself out.'
3.I won't take you into my castle, but I won't banish you from the kingdom either. Do as you please. @'That's understandable, Your Grace,' the princess said. She must've been hoping for an invitation into the castle, but to be able to stay in the kingdom was good enough. 'Just, do me a favour,' she said before making her leave. 'Don't tell anyone I'm here.'
|
{1-13=1[1]}1-13=2:Alistair Kyntha, The Hand of The King:'Princess Fiorella has settled herself nicely in the castle,' The Hand said. 'No one knows about it other than you, me, and a few of our most loyal men. It's been made public knowledge that she was here, of course. It's hard to miss her when she's dressed up like a traditional Eldorian royal. But I made sure to spread news that she had left,' The Hand said, finishing his report. When you didn't respond immediately, he added, 'There's still the matter of her men, Your Grace. We must consider the possibility that this is a ruse. I don't like the idea of this group of Eldorian guards roaming the capital freely. I've half a mind to have them put under house arrest until this situation has sorted itself.
1.I agree with you. They shouldn't be allowed to roam freely. @The Hand nodded. 'I'll see to it, then. If they truly care about keeping their princess safe, then they should come without a fight. We can gage wether or not this whole thing is a ruse based on their reactions.'
2.Let them roam, they won't do anything. I doubt Fiorella was lying to me. @The Hand sighed. 'Very well, but I'll assign some of our men to watch them. Frankly, Your Grace, I don't trust Eldoria.'
|
{1-13=2[1]}1-13=3:Ser Alaric, Captain of the Guards:'The... situation with the Eldorian princess's guards has been handled, Your Grace,' Ser Alaric started. 'We had them arrested, and they came without a fight, fortunately.
1.Good work, but make sure you're not being too hard on them. They may not be enemies. @'It's just a precaution,' Alaric said, finishing your thought. 'I know. That's what Alistair said as well. They didn't fight us, though. Makes me think your princess is telling the truth. And if she is, then what? Eldoria knows she's been here, Your Grace. If she's really being hunted by them, they'll come looking for her.'
|
{1-13=2[2]}1-13=4:Ser Alaric, Captain of the Guards:'Your Grace, we've been keeping watch on the princess's men, as The Hand asked, but they don't seem to be doing anything. They just wander the capital, blending in with the city watch. They go to brothels, drink, and some have even found some part time work.'
1.It's as I expected, then. @'Seems so, Your Grace,' Alaric said in agreement. 'Means your princess is telling the truth. And if she is, then what? Eldoria knows she's been here, Your Grace. If she's really being hunted by them, they'll come looking for her.'
|
{1-13=1[2]}1-13=5:Ser Alaric, Captain of the Guards:'We have a problem,' the captain announced, his voice deadly serious. It had been a long time since you'd seen Alaric look so panicked. 'It's about the Eldorian princess. We escorted her from the kingdom, as you asked, but...' He paused, taking the time to breathe and recompose himself. 'The princess and her guards were found by one of our patrols, Your Grace, only a few miles beyond our border into the unclaimed lands. They were all dead. When I first heard of it, I assumed it was her father, the Eldorian king, coming to finish the job, but... we found this in the remains of their burnt encampment,' he said, taking a cloth from his inner coat pocket and raising it so you could see. The cloth was dirty, but beneath the grey ash you could clearly make out black, red, and golden hues. The official colours of the Empire of The Sun. Colours of royalty. Colours of power. Colours that changed everything. 'This goes deeper than just an Eldorian family scandal, Your Grace,' Alaric added. 'The Empire is involved. What does it mean?'
1.It means we investigate the situation. @Alaric nodded in agreement. 'An Eldorian princess targetted by both the Empire of The Sun and her own father. I'd like to know more about it as well.'
2.It means we forget about this whole ordeal, and count ourselves lucky the attack happened outside our boder. @Ser Alaric nodded. 'Yes, Your Grace. Eldoria is a manageable enemy, but the empire? If it came to violence between us and them, I know who I'd bet on.'
|
{1-13=5[1]}1-13=6:Alistair Kyntha, The Hand of The King:'We've found nothing,' The Hand announced. 'We gathered the corpses of the dead Eldorians, but we've found no clues as to what exactly happened. All we found was that cloth bearing the Empire's colours.'
1.There's nothing more to do. @'Yes, Your Grace,' The Hand said. 'I'll see that the bodies are burned, and I'll  keep the men who know of this quiet.'
|
{1-13=1[3]}1-13=7:Ser Alaric, Captain of the Guards:'We have a problem,' the captain announced, his voice deadly serious. It had been a long time since you'd seen Alaric look so panicked. 'It's about the Eldorian princess. When you sent her away, telling her to do as she pleased, it seems she decided to leave the kingdom, maybe to find refuge somewhere else. I had guards following her, and they confirmed she left, but...' He paused, taking the time to breathe and recompose himself. 'The princess and her guards were found by one of our patrols, Your Grace, only a few miles beyond our border into the unclaimed lands. They were all dead.

<1-13=1[1]>1-13=9:Vorin, Eldorian Captain:'I know the princess was here,' the Eldorian guard captain said, threat in his voice. He was lucky he had even been allowed to live, let alone been given an audience with you. 'If you don't return her to us, then it'll be war,' he added.
1.*truth* She's here, but she came here willingly, fearing for her safety. Why should I give her back to you? @The captain gritted his teeth in frustration. 'Because she is Eldorian, and she is not yours to protect. The King wants her back, and if you don't comply, it will be war.' You didn't answer him, chosing only to smile antagonistically. Yes, she was here with you, and she wasn't going anywhere. If it was to be a war, then so be it, but it seemed unlikely. If the Eldorian King really did want his daughter dead, then having her here in your kingdom and away from her rightful throne would suit his needs.
2.*lie* She's not here. @'You lie,' the captain said. 'If you think I'm so stupid that I'd believe the story you spun about her leaving your kingdom, then you're wrong. I'll see her returned, or it'll be war.' You didn't answer him, chosing only to smile antagonistically. Yes, she was here with you, and she wasn't going anywhere. If it was to be a war, then so be it, but it seemed unlikely. If the Eldorian King really did want his daughter dead, then having her here in your kingdom and away from her rightful throne would suit his needs.
3.*lie* She's my hostage. @The captain widened his eyes in surprise. He must have expected you to take her in, not hold her hostage. Not that you were actually holding her hostage, of course. It was just a ruse to see how he would react. 'This will be war, you realise?' the captain said. 'The King will not suffer his daughter being held captive.' But he would suffer her dead, you added in thought before ordering the captain sent away. If it was to be a war, then so be it, but it seemed unlikely. If the Eldorian King really did want his daughter dead, then having her “held hostage" in your kingdom and away from her rightful throne would suit his needs.

1.*truth* She's dead, along with her entire entourage. She asked for help, and I turned her away, so she left. Though, in the rubble of their camp, I found this... @At the sight of the imperial cloth that you had just lifted to show him, the Eldorian captain's eyes went wide with shock. Out of all the ways that this encounter could have gone, it was clear to you that this was the one that the captain had expected the least, as well as the one that he feared the most. What was the significance of the cloth. Before you could ask the captain, however, he spun and made to leave. You could have stopped him, but chose not to.

{1-13=9[0]}1-13=11:Rayella, Sorceress of The Sun:The throne room was empty safe for yourself and the white haired woman with glowing, ember eyes before you. Rayella, Sorceress of The Sun, and the Emperor's right hand. She was the second most powerful person in the world, and she was here before you, but why? Why had she suddenly shown up here and ordered that everyone leave. What was so important that the Empire itself needed to tell you in private, and from the mouth of Rayella herself. 'Doubtless you wonder why I've come, O' ruler,' she started. 'Tis a simple matter, but a serious one. I've come to make sure you obey. The princess Fiorella is safe and behind these walls, this I know. I also know that you care for her, and that you wish her to be safe, but these feelings must be forgotten. She will die soon, and you will do nothing. Why? You ask?' she started, noticing the look on confusion on your face. 'She is royal blood, and I don't just mean Eldorian. She is blood of the Emperor. The offspring of one of his sons. Her father learned of this, and plotted to use her against the empire. When she learned she was just a pawn, she ran away. The point of this explanation, O' ruler, is to eliminate any remaining questions you have and ensure you do not say a word of this to anyone.'
1.Fiorella has to die, then. To protect the Empire. @'Yes,' Rayella said simply. 'It must be done. She has blood of the empire, but she is only half blooded. A bastard. The blood of the empire must run pure and direct. Branches from its tree must be snipped, lest it grow out of control. And in terms of her father, well. You do not oppose the empire and live. It's a simple fact.'
2.I won't stand by and let you kill her. @'But you will, O' ruler, or you too will meet your end at the hand of an Arbiter,' Rayella warned. 'Fiorella will die. This is a fact you cannot change. She has blood of the empire, but she is only half blooded. A bastard. The blood of the empire must run pure and direct. Branches from its tree must be snipped, lest it grow out of control.

'I know you were ordered to keep quiet about the princess Fiorella's imperial execution, and I'm glad you told me of it after your meeting with Rayella, but... there's still time to make a move. We can send men, have her guarded.' He took a deep breath. The situation was stressing him out, clearly. 'She's just a girl,' he added in softly spoken thought.
1.We do nothing. Rayella came here herself to warn me to do nothing and keep quiet. @'You're right, of course,' he said, truly meaning it. It seemed like he was disapointed more in himself for even considering an action that would place a single girl from an enemy kingdom above you, the ruler of his kingdom. 'We must do nothing, I understand that. To be honest, it would have been better if you hadn't told me. Or even better, if Rayella hadn't come. We wouldn't have been faced with this choice.'
2.You're right. There's still a chance. @The Hand smiled. 'I'm glad you see it my way, Your Grace. I'll see she's well protected for the next while. The empire might not make a move.'

{1-13=12[1]}1-13=13:Alistair Kyntha, The Hand of The King:'She's dead,' The Hand announced upon entering the throne room. He didn't have to say her name. You knew it all too well. It hadn't left your mind since your encounter with Rayella. 'It happened in the night. An Arbiter, I'd bet,' he said, sighing sadly. 'Not that it matters. She's gone, and we couldn't do a single thing.'
1.There was nothing we could have done. @'We could have done plenty,' The Hand countered, but his tone wasn't angry. 'It was just that this was the only option that left us alive. Anyway, we... we have a kingdom to run. Let's get back to it.'
|
{1-13=12[2]}1-13=13:Arbiter:You had been expecting The Hand today, but when you spotted the Arbiter and its terrifying eyes as it marched into the throne room, you weren't surprised either. Part of you knew this was coming. It was decided the moment you decided to try to protect Fiorella. The moment you opposed Rayella. The guards at the sides of the throne room moved to try to protect you, but they all fell to the Arbiter. It killed them with ease. Such ease that it seemed bored by the slaughter. Imagine that. A killer so perfect that it struggles to find prey that even hold a candle to it. It wouldn't find that in you, you thought as the Arbiter finished off your guards, turning its eyes to you. You were just a king, not a fighter. You could try, though. To resist. But was it really worth it?
1.*fight* @Might as well, you thought as you stood up from the throne, charging forward and grabbing one of your fallen guard's swords. The blade was heavy in your hand, but you swung it at the charging Arbiter all the same. It did nothing. The Arbiter's strike came first and clean, sending you falling to the floor, mortally wounded. As you faded into the void, you felt warm. The warmth of familiarity, as though you had died a dozen times before. What a strange thought. (Population-100000000)
2.*accept defeat* @No, there was no point fighting. You sat there, waiting, as the Arbiter charged at you and, with an almighty strike, ended your brief rule over your kingdom. As you faded into the void, you felt warm. The warmth of familiarity, as though you had died a dozen times before. What a strange thought. (Population-100000000)

{1-13=13[0]}1-13=14:Alistair Kyntha, The Hand of The King:'I have news, Your Grace,' The Hand said as he walked into the throne room. It had been some time since the ordeal with Fiorella, but something about the look on The Hand's face told you that it wasn't over just yet. 'Eldoria is gone,' he said simply. 'The Empire attacked. It's on fire. The forests, the grasslands, the cities and capital. It's all burning.'
1."You do not oppose the empire and live." @'"It's a simple fact,"' The Hand said, finishing the quote. 'Rayella's words. Seems she was not lying, but a whole kingdom? Eldoria was not minor, and yet it was destroyed overnight, like it was nothing.' He turned to look out one of the throne room's massive stained glass windows. 'It could've been us,' he said softly in horrified thought. 'If you had chosen differently, it... it could've been us.'
